# 🎮⚽️ FIFA 21 - Beyond the rating

Welcome to this EDA project based on EA Sports **FIFA 21** player dataset.
In this notebook, we will explore various aspects of the dataset to gain insights into player attributes, performance ratings, and other characteristics.

## 🔎 Questions Investigated

- 📊 How is player age distributed?
- 🌍 How does height vary by nationality?

- 🧓 How does overall rating vary by age?
- 💰 How are player market values distributed?
- 🦶 Does preferred foot influence overall rating?
- 🧩 How are player positions distributed?
- 🌟 How does international reputation correlate with overall rating?
- 🦶 What is the distribution of weak foot ratings?
- 🎯 How does the skill moves rating affect player market value?

- 💪 How does body type vary by player position?
- 🧑‍🦰 How do "real face" players differ from others?
- 🕹️ What is the correlation between dribbling ability and overall rating?
- 🏆 How do player wages vary across leagues?

We will use Python along with powerful data visualization and analysis libraries to explore these questions and uncover interesting patterns in the data.
